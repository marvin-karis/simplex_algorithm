We use the linprog function from the scipy.optimize library to solve a simple linear programming problem with three constraints. The objective function is to minimize the cost of resource allocation, subject to the three constraints defined in the A matrix and the b vector. The simplex method is used to solve the problem and find the optimal resource allocation, which is printed to the console.
This code can be modified to include additional constraints and objectives to solve more complex resource allocation problems. However, it is important to carefully define the problem and constraints before attempting to write an algorithm or code to solve it.
